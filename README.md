This is Terraria Text Adventure! Originally made by
Titus Domey, Darius Collins, and Kiretan Amin, with 
assistance from Rafael Mather-Alvear. T.T.A. is a "little" 
project we have been working on. It is a text adventure 
style game similar to Zork, Planetfall, and other great 
I.F. games from the 80's, but strives to imitate the 
actual gameplay of the 2D indie survival game "Terraria".
